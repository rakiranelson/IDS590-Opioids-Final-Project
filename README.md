Population and fips merge may need additional attention. The issue are the combinations of different county spellings, countries changing name (especially in AL), countries merging and splitting, and fip codes changing over time. Further cleaning may be required.

For the sake of this rough draft, the final `deaths_with_pop` merged dataframe will be computed by an inner join.
