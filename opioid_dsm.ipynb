    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Florida experienced a rapid rise in opioid shipments and overdose deaths during the late 2000s, driven in part by widespread “pill mill” activity. In response, the state enacted a series of major opioid prescribing restrictions beginning in 2010. This memo evaluates whether these policies reduced prescription opioid shipments and overdose mortality, using county-level data from 2006–2015 and comparing Florida to demographically and behaviorally similar states with parallel pre-policy trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our findings show that Florida’s 2010 opioid regulations were associated with a substantial reduction in prescription opioid shipments, beginning immediately after the policy went into effect. However, overdose deaths declined only modestly and temporarily before rising again in later years, consistent with concerns that reduced access to prescription opioids pushed some individuals toward illicit opioids such as heroin or fentanyl. These results suggest that while prescribing policies are effective at reducing the supply of prescription opioids, they must be paired with broader harm-reduction and treatment strategies to sustainably reduce overdose deaths."

    "## Decisions To Be Made\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this analysis, the Florida Department of Health faces two decisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Should Florida continue or expand regulations targeting high-risk opioid prescribers?\n",
    "\n",
    "The evidence strongly suggests these measures reduce prescription opioid availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Should Florida pair prescribing regulations with additional interventions to prevent overdose deaths?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the reductions in shipments were not matched by sustained reductions in mortality, Florida should consider expanding medication-assisted treatment (MAT), naloxone access, and surveillance of illicit opioid markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remainder of this memo provides the evidence required to make these decisions."
